One in four people aged 65 or older said they can confidently tell within seconds whether they are attracted to a new date, while just 19 per cent of peopled aged 45 or older could say the same.\\n\\nPeople in their 60s were also revealed to be more likely to end a date within minutes if they don't immediately take to the person they are with.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"D ominic Clark’s grandparents were always lively, with a mischievous sense fun\\n\\nHis grandmother was never less than beautifully turned out and, at parties, the two of them would easily out-dance their grandchildren. But Dominic only knew the bare bones of his grandparents’ life story. He knew Stanley went to war as a teenager and met Anneliese swimming in a German river, just after peace was declared in 1945. But not much else.\\n\\nSo when Dominic’s wife Jenn presented him with a published account of his grandparents’ lives on his 40th birthday, he declared it the best day of his life. Jenn had dug out photos, spoken to family, found old tape recordings of his grandparents discussing their experiences, and sent them to family biographers Story Terrace. Professional writers had turned their story around, unearthing heart-rending details from the past. He held in his hands an extraordinary love story.\\n\\nOn one of their first dates, Anneliese snuck out of her parents’ home against their wishes to change into a silky party dress\\n\\nIt began a month after the war ended, when Annaliese emerged from a dip in the river near the German village where she was staying, to find Stanley and another British soldier talking to her friend. Grabbing her towel, she gave them a piece of her mind; her home had just been requisitioned by British forces and her family had no food. Stanley was smitten. They went on to meet every day until Stanley had to move on.\\n\\nAfter an idyllic early childhood, fun-loving Anneliese had already experienced her fair share of suffering during wartime Germany. Her handsome fiancé, a pilot in the Luftwaffe, had been shot down during the war; another boyfriend was killed in 1944. She and her family had survived an intense night of bombing – after Dresden and Cologne, her home of Magdeburg was the third most severely damaged city in Germany.\\n\\nLove at first sight: as soon as Stanley met Anneliese, he was smitten\\n\\nStanley, the eldest brother of five, had left a steady job at Debenhams to join the Royal Horseguards in 1942 at 18. He’d been sent to Syria, where he was charged with scouting behind enemy lines, and on through Italy, where he’d seen vehicles blown up in front of him. “Fear rode with you, and it sharpened [your] wits,” he remembered.\\n\\nThey spent an intense fortnight together. On one of their first dates, Anneliese snuck out of her parents’ home against their wishes to change into a silky party dress. “I have always, ever since that night, liked to dress nicely for Stanley,” she remembered.\\n\\nAnneliese urged her parents to escape, but they wouldn’t leave their home. 'In the end I chose to go without them'\\n\\nBoth had found moments of happiness amid the cruelty – Stanley gazing at stars in a Damascus sky or successfully manoeuvring men and machinery across fast-flowing European rivers. For Anneliese it was standing up to authorities, decorating rooms with wild flowers or concocting novel meals from scant rations. Both saw the horrors of Nazi Germany.\\n\\nAfter Stanley’s regiment moved on in 1945 to make way for Russian occupiers, Anneliese was faced with an agonising decision – stay with her parents, or follow Stanley. He begged her to leave with him. She declined; he left her with a photo. Anneliese urged her parents to escape, but they wouldn’t leave their home. “In the end I chose to go without them,” she remembered.\\n\\nLove conquers all: Stanley and Anneliese's love story is a true inspiration\\n\\nShe left with virtually nothing, accompanied by a friend and bound for the British-controlled zone, dodging patrols in the night-time woods to avoid capture, with shots ringing out behind them. They crossed into safe territory but it took a week for word to reach Stanley, who returned and stowed her away in an army truck, risking his life to smuggle her to safety. Reunited, they stayed together, eventually stopping in Bonn, where Stanley found Anneliese lodgings. She made one last daring visit to her parents in the Russian zone, once more fleeing Russian patrols as she crossed back to the West “sprinting to the border like rabbits”.\\n\\nIn 1946 Bonn, Stanley and Anneliese became engaged – only to be told marriage between English and German citizens was banned. And so they returned to settle in Lewisham as Mr and Mrs Greene, after a quiet English wedding ceremony. Annaliese’s mother, despite living in terrible poverty in the rubble of Germany, went on sending presents to her daughter and her new family.\\n\\nStanley returned and stowed her away in an army truck, risking his life to smuggle her to safety\\n\\nThey had two daughters and Stanley went on to set up his own business as a fashion agent. When they eventually left the smog of London for village life in Kent, Anneliese insisted on having a car – a Mini – to get out and about. She adapted to her new home, but never came to terms with kippers, or mint sauce.\\n\\n“The sheer scale of their life does blow me away,” says Dominic, who named his first daughter after Anneliese. “They were wonderful grandparents. When you read everything they went through, I understand how much they made the most of their lives. I hadn’t realised what a deep love story theirs was. The war formed who they were.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

Opt for the heart-healthy unsaturated fats in foods such as oily fish, rapeseed oil and avocado. Adults should aim to keep below 20g of saturated fat per day. Try not to add blood- pressure-raising salt to your food: add flavour with garlic, pepper, lemon juice and chilli.\\n\\nEat oily fish\\n\\nWe should eat at least two 140g portions of fish a week, of which one should be oily, such as mackerel, sardines, fresh tuna and salmon. If you don’t, it may be worthwhile to supplement your diet with something full of goodness such as cod liver oil – rich in omega-3s, plus vitamins D and E that can help replenish your natural resources.\\n\\nGo for wholegrain carbs\\n\\nWhite bread, pasta and rice have been stripped of their bran coating and germ in the milling process, leaving just the endosperm. Starchy carbohydrates with a low GI (like wholegrains) release their energy slowly, so they’re better for refuelling the brain and body. The fibre in them also keeps your digestive system running smoothly. We’re advised to eat at least 30g of fibre every day (on average, we eat 18g).\\n\\nRemember calcium\\n\\nAdults over the age of 19 should eat 700 milligrams of calcium a day, equivalent to a 200ml glass of milk, one small pot of low-fat fruit yoghurt, and a matchbox-sized piece of cheese. Post menopause, women are susceptible to osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) so it is vital that they eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, to minimise bone loss.\\n\\nEat fruit and veg\\n\\nOnly one in three adults and 41 per cent of older adults meets the five-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation1. Take advantage of seasonal produce as fruit and veg are another great source of fibre. They also contain main vitamins and minerals.\\n\\nBe moderate\\n\\nWe generally need to eat less, move more and enjoy a variety of different foods – fruit and vegetables, starchy wholegrain carbs, dairy and alternatives, and beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins, as shown in the new Eatwell Guide. There's no need to be a puritan. Some sugary foods are fine in moderation – a flavoured yoghurt will bring with it calcium, protein and iodine, and a wholegrain breakfast with added sugar may offer fibre, folic acid and other B vitamins.\\n\\n1Public Health England (2014) National Diet and Nutrition Survey: Results from Years 1-4 (combined) of the Rolling Programme (2008/2009 – 2011/12)\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

I have made so many friends while restoring our canals,” she says.\\n\\n“I even met my husband Mike while doing my first dig, so you really never know what will happen once you get involved with this type of voluntary work.”\\n\\nJude is one of hundreds of volunteers who give up some of their holidays to work on the canals every year. And with some 6,500 miles of used and disused waterways criss-crossing England and Wales, there is no shortage of jobs to be done.\\n\\nMuch of the work is overseen by the Waterway Recovery Group (WRG), which was set up more than 45 years ago to help maintain and bring back our canals. Each year, especially in the summer, it runs canal camps where volunteers of all ages (the minimum age is now 18) and from all backgrounds are welcomed along to lend a hand.\\n\\nAnother brick in the wall: Jude Palmer is a life-long canal lover\\n\\nJenny Black, volunteer co-ordinator for the WRG, says these camps are so popular that it has introduced even more this year, with more than 30 planned from now until mid-September. Others happen throughout the year, with one even running during the Christmas break.\\n\\n“We contact the various canal societies, which tell us what upcoming work they need help with in the following year. We then decide which projects to send our canal camp team to,” says Jenny.\\n\\n“The camps consist of 18 to 20 volunteers with a leader, an assistant and a cook to look after the team. All we ask is that volunteers bring a pair of safety boots and we supply the rest of the gear and on-the-job training.”\\n\\nA week on the camp costs £63, which includes all food and accommodation. In return, the WRG teaches volunteers various skills ranging from bricklaying to operating a digger truck. Work includes clearing vegetation and using heritage skills to rebuild lock gate chambers using traditional materials.\\n\\n“The range of people who volunteer is incredible. At the younger end, those completing their Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards come along. We also have retired people who can spare the time.\\n\\n“We also get lots of working people doing it in their holidays. It’s a real cross-section but we seem to have lots of teachers, administrators, IT professionals and police officers signing up.

Teenagers who were already cared for by the charity could apply to go to the former country estate in Hertfordshire to complete their schooling and learn a trade.\\n\\nJimmy arrived there after being cared for since he was aged six at a Barnardo’s home in his native Belfast. After his mother died, his dad struggled to look after him and his young siblings. He went to Goldings when he was 13.\\n\\nColin was cared for by the charity from when he was eight after his single mum was unable to cope with bringing up him and his brother. He had just become a teenager when he arrived there from Manchester and, like Jimmy, left after turning 16.\\n\\n“The first time I met Colin was when he was sitting in the school reading a newspaper,” recalls Jimmy. “I supported Burnley and asked if there was any news on them in the sports pages. He was a Manchester United supporter and that’s how we got talking.”\\n\\nSport, and particularly football, bound them together.

I even named my second son Colin after him,” says Jimmy.\\n\\nIn 1962, the pair left Goldings within months of each other, and went their separate ways. After returning to their home cities, they got jobs, married, had children and grandchildren, too.\\n\\nBut they never forgot each other.\\n\\n“We’d made a vow to meet up after we left Goldings, but for some reason it never happened,” says Jimmy.\\n\\n“It wasn’t so easy back then before the internet and mobile phones. My wife Eileen tried to find him online, but never succeeded. I asked Barnardo’s, but they had no recent records about where Colin was.”\\n\\n“I’d been searching for him for years too,” says Colin, who is now registered blind. “I never even knew if he was still alive or dead.

       "  'text': \"You might not have sung - apart from in the shower - since you left school. But thousands of people are now discovering their singing voice by joining a new type of choir\\n\\nWendy Neale has had Thursdays circled in her diary every week for the past 11 years.\\n\\nIt’s when she attends her regular practice for Rock Choir, the hugely successful contemporary singing phenomenon that has been rolled out across the UK. Already more than 24,000 people have joined some 320 choirs to learn to sing pop songs and classic tunes together.\\n\\n“I’ve never had a moment of regret about joining , as it has given me untold fun ever since I started,” says Wendy, who joined the first ever Rock Choir that was set up in Farnham, Surrey, in 2005. She has been a loyal member ever since.\\n\\nIn that time she has learnt to sing everything from Beatles ballads to uplifting gospel songs and a huge variety in between. Whether it’s a golden oldie such as ELO’s Mr Blue Sky or Beyoncé’s download sensation Halo, Wendy and the other choirs nationwide will hone it in the church halls and hotel rooms they rehearse in.\\n\\nAfter weeks of painstaking practice, they get the chance to perform it in venues ranging from shopping centres to the O2 or Wembley Arena. Wendy has sung in a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and made a recording at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, too.\\n\\nStrength in numbers: there are now 320 Rock Choirs in the UK\\n\\nMore of these choirs are due to spring up later this year and many existing members share the same enthusiasm for Rock Choir as 71-year-old Wendy, a retired business manager.\\n\\n“I had no history or experience in choirs before I joined,” Wendy says. “And not having to be able to read music or needing to audition really appealed to me.\\n\\n“The ethos of Rock Choir is to be totally inclusive and not judge people on ability or talent. It’s like one big family where everyone’s welcome.\\n\\n“I’ve made lots of good friends from the choir. Not only is everyone supportive when we are singing, but outside choir, too. If anyone is having a bad time, the way the others rally round is incredible.”\\n\\nRock Choir was founded by professional singer and musician Caroline Redman Lusher, who first got the idea while teaching A-level performing arts students who couldn’t read music. So instead she taught them to sing by rote around the piano and their grades and confidence soared.\\n\\nCaroline decided to try the simple concept on others. She put out flyers where she lived in Surrey asking if locals wanted to sing in a modern choir. After 70 people showed up at the inaugural coffee shop gathering, Caroline knew she was on to something.\\n\\nWithin six months plans were underway to start up Rock Choirs across the country. Each had a trained musician as its leader who would follow the model established by Caroline, who continues to be its director. There are now 66 leaders and more being recruited to satisfy growing demand.\\n\\nGood vibrations: many Rock Choirs put on charity concerts\\n\\n“I felt I’d come across something that did lots of good and made people really happy, too,” says Caroline. “I strongly feel now it’s my responsibility to carry that on.\\n\\n“We often hear amazing tales from our members who tell us that they haven’t sung for 20 or 30 or more years after a teacher at school once said they were useless at singing. And now their confidence is there, they’re performing at some of the country’s best-known venues, when before they didn’t think they could sing a note.”\\n\\nThe choirs are open to all aged 18 and above. Both sexes are welcome, although by far the majority of members are female.\\n\\nAfter being welcomed, new members can progress at their own pace. The songs are chosen by Caroline who works out how the choir leaders can best teach them. More experienced choirs might work on trickier arrangements while newer ones start on more simple pieces.\\n\\nRock Choir members - or Rockies as they’re known - often carry out flash mob appearances at both big and small locations, and also appear at charity events to support and fundraise for good causes.\\n\\n“It’s hard to pin down whether it’s the singing, the friendship, the fulfilment from doing a new activity or the positive vibes our members feel that they most like. It’s probably a combination of everything,” says Caroline.\\n\\n“I’m still amazed that something so natural as singing can transform lives in such a simple way.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTo find out more, visit rockchoir.com\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"Children who visit a riding school in Brixton are often scared the first time they come face to face with a horse.\\n\\n“Animals have negative connotations for them,” says volunteer riding instructor Sue Collins. “Dogs on the estates where they live can be aggressive. Some are really frightened at first.”\\n\\nTo coax the more timid into the stables, the centre owns Pedro, a small Shetland pony with a friendly face.\\n\\nThis is Ebony Horse Club. It’s not the kind of riding school where children trot around during a lesson and go home again. Nestling between Fifties tower blocks and a railway line in one of the country’s most deprived areas in Lambeth, it’s a sanctuary for many local children.\\n\\nTen horses are stabled here, and many of the children and young people who visit are referred for a range of reasons – behaviour issues, difficult home lives, trouble at school.\\n\\n“There is something very calming about being around animals,” says Collins, who’s chair of the charity’s trustees.\\n\\nMy little pony: children are first introduced to the club's friendly Shetland\\n\\nRecently a boy with a mental health condition spoke his first word for eight years. It was “buddy” – and he was talking to the horse he was grooming. “There were a few tears in the yard that day,” says Collins. “It was remarkable.”\\n\\nEbony Horse Club began nearly years 20 ago as a club for a handful of children, but didn’t have a base until 2011.\\n\\nThis was built after one of its teenage members and star riders Nathan Foster was stabbed to death in 2007. In the wake of the news coverage, funds flowed in and the centre was built; it opened five years ago.\\n\\nAlthough small, it’s caught the attention of prominent figures. Broadcaster Alistair Stewart helps with fundraising and Clare Balding was amazed at the level of riding when she dropped by. The Duchess of Cornwall is president and even the Queen has visited.\\n\\nSome 400 children and young people now ride here, both at weekends and evenings, and a floodlit space allows lessons to continue throughout the winter.\\n\\nChildren can join at the age of eight, and although lists are heaving, the club does its best to accept all children referred by schools, social workers and charities.\\n\\n“I remember seeing the stables being built from the balcony where I live, so I came down and found out how I could learn to ride,” says Cameron, a teenager who joined in 2011. “It’s changed the way I feel about life.”\\n\\nHorse play: young riders put the ponies through their paces at Ebony Horse Club\\n\\nOne rider who joined as a young child in foster care from a particularly difficult background has just gone on to further education, which makes Collins proud.\\n\\nIn fact, some 70 per cent of the centre’s over-16s have gone on to equine studies, and three are already employed in the industry.\\n\\nThis is remarkable given the home lives of some of the children. Many come from broken families and poor housing; some face challenges such as gang crime and poverty; many don’t reach their potential at school.\\n\\nYouth workers know it’s much easier to chat to a child when he or she might be grooming a horse or mucking out, rather than in a sterile face-to-face situation, says Collins. “We hand-pick our youth workers, they are trained and on the lookout for children who need support.”\\n\\nIn the horsey world, boys generally lose interest as they enter their teens and riding is seen as a bit “girly”. Not so at Ebony, says Collins. “We hang on to our boys in equal numbers; they don’t tend to leave.”\\n\\nAnd the standard of riding is remarkably high, she says. “We focus on excellence, we want aspirations to be high.” When British show jumping gold medallist Ben Maher visited the school, he was amazed at how accomplished the pupils were.\\n\\n“He expected us to be trotting around, but the children were jumping, competing. They were really engaged.” Some even get to play polo.\\n\\nJumping for joy: the local community relishes having a horse club on its doorstep\\n\\nEbony Horse Club isn’t a large charity but it casts a large footprint. Even if people don’t ride, they often pop by to chat on the way to work, says Collins.\\n\\n“Mums bring their children to see the horses.” And the premises, tucked into a local park, are rarely vandalised. “It feels as if the community wants to protect us – they know we’re doing the right thing for the children.”\\n\\nWhen instructors take young people on residential trips – pony trekking in the Brecon Beacons or to an estate in Gloucestershire – students relish leaving the city. For many it’s the first time outside Brixton.\\n\\n“You see teenagers running around like little children,” says Collins. “They love the freedom of being outdoors. Often their parents are terrified to let them out at home for fear of gangs. Or they might be out on the streets but getting up to mischief. It’s remarkable to see them flourish.”\\n\\nOf course, not every child can be helped by a couple of sessions a week, and sometimes problems can be too complicated for staff to assist successfully.\\n\\n“It’s not an easy fix,” agrees Collins. “Some children with low self-esteem might be aggressive or withdrawn. But as they spend time with the horses, their empathy grows, as does their sense of responsibility. Horses don’t answer back, they give unconditional love. Ultimately, horses are the best teachers.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"A last-minute holiday costing less than £200 changed Ruth Gunay’s life forever when she discovered love on a Mediterranean beach\\n\\nSitting in a travel agency 18 years ago, Ruth Gunay was desperately trying to find a cheap week away for her and a friend to enjoy some summer sun.\\n\\nBut the decision to choose Turkey over Ibiza – the only two destinations the agent could offer her – ended up changing the entire course of her life.\\n\\nWe instantly got on really well... it seemed both ridiculous but very real Ruth Gunay\\n\\n“At the time I’d finished university and was working as a management trainee while studying for my master’s degree,” says Ruth, who was 24 when she went on her Turkish holiday with her longstanding mate, Flora.\\n\\n“I was a career-minded girl and this was a really good graduate job. I had my next few years all mapped out.\\n\\n“For my holiday, I simply wanted to go somewhere quiet where I could sit on the beach with a book. I knew I wouldn’t get that in Ibiza. Flora persuaded me to book Turkey, even though I’d never fancied going there before. I remember it cost £179.”\\n\\nIt was while Ruth and Flora, who grew up together in Sheffield, were relaxing on a beach in the resort of Kemer that they first met Faruk. He ran a watersports centre there with his brother and they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the women to try water skiing.\\n\\nWhen sparks fly: Faruk and Ruth have a similar outlook on life Credit: James Bryne\\n\\nAs the week wore on, Faruk and Ruth started chatting when they saw each other. A spark developed between them.\\n\\n“We instantly got on really well. At the time I remember thinking this was all unbelievable as I didn’t come here looking for this but just to have a relaxing week on the beach. It seemed both ridiculous but also very real.”\\n\\nThe pair kept in phone contact once Ruth went home after the holiday in July 1998. But Faruk persuaded her to return for a fortnight in September and again at Christmas.\\n\\nAfter returning to her London life, Ruth realised she really wanted to be back in Turkey with Faruk. In the February after they met, to the surprise of her bosses, colleagues and family, she ended her old life and began a new one in Kemer.\\n\\nWhen we first got together, people were worried about whether it would last Ruth Gunay\\n\\n“I rationalised it to myself by saying going to spend the summer with Faruk was like having a gap year. I spent my days working on the beach when only a few weeks before I’d been in a corporate office world. It seemed so bizarre, but also where I wanted to be.”\\n\\nWhen the holiday season was over, the pair returned to London, where Ruth did temping jobs and Faruk improved his English.\\n\\nIn 2001, less than three years after they first met, they married in Ankara.\\n\\nWhile they expanded their business in the resort in the next few years, the couple also had two daughters - Esma, who is now 13, and Yasemine, 10. It was only when Esma was old enough to start school that the family’s thoughts turned towards moving back to England.\\n\\nIn 2007 they settled in Ruth’s native Sheffield. Just before Christmas 2009, after finding an ideal location in the Broomhill area of the city, they opened a Turkish restaurant.

The restaurant is around the corner from where my parents used to live and next to a pub we visited when we came over from Turkey,” says Ruth, now 42.\\n\\nToday the restaurant - called Lokanta - is continuing to grow in popularity and is praised in the city’s eating-out guides. Last week, the couple expanded their business by opening a healthy Turkish takeaway food outlet, too.\\n\\n“We might be from different countries, but we’ve both got in common: a desire to rise to a challenge. We both go for opportunities and take them when they come our way.\\n\\n“This attitude led me to going to live in Turkey and now running our restaurant together.”\\n\\nRuth does feel it was a real Sliding Doors moment of fate, and if she had decided to holiday in Ibiza rather than Turkey, her life would now be so different.\\n\\n“When we first got together, people were worried about whether it would last.

       "  'text': \"As a busy chief executive of a successful computer games developer, Jason Kingsley knows how to relax. And it’s usually as a 12th-century knight, on top of some 500 kilos of frisky stallion, practising for battle\\n\\nKingsley, at the age of 50, is currently nursing a few grazes and bruises after a weekend with his war horses. He owns a suit of armour – an original model fashioned by a medieval engineer – and his spare time is spent re-enacting war games or jousting for real.\\n\\n“I’ve always been fascinated by knights, armour, castles. But I wonder what it must have been like to really ‘live’ it. What we learn in books is just scraping the surface,” says Kingsley.\\n\\nHe leads independent games developer Rebellion which, along with other developers, is driving the move towards virtual reality in gaming. Behind his desk at work, he keeps a selection of lances and a couple of medieval swords. “People do find it slightly intimidating in business meetings,” he says. “It helps focus the mind.”\\n\\nAnd in between his working day, he’ll spend a couple of hours, morning and night, looking after his war horses on his Buckinghamshire farm, where he breeds from his collection of stallions and mares.\\n\\nHe’s recently managed to track down a baroque stallion with an old-world physique – stockier and stronger than modern horses. He doesn’t watch much television or have much time to socialise, though he does love to play the odd computer game when he can.\\n\\nHe was drawn to jousting, and the ancient heraldic code of honour after seeing it in action at English Heritage. He first learned to ride at eight when his parents bought him a pony, and he’s been perfecting his skills ever since, leading the British university riding team to compete internationally during his time at the University of Oxford.\\n\\nKnight club: Jason's armour is for safety rather than fancy dress Credit: Kasumi Kitano\\n\\nKingsley follows his own code of honour – in private and in business, and received an OBE in 2012 for services to the British economy; he heads the independent games developers association TIGA and he’s also a trustee of the Royal Armouries, the UK’s museum of arms and armour.\\n\\nHe gives regularly to children’s charities and helps SpecialEffect, a charity which helps children with disability enjoy gaming. “The chivalric code applies to business, too,” he says. “It was originally designed to control the more violent instincts of men. If you are strong, you mustn’t be a bully. It means being honest and fair – I think the world is a better place if you’re decent.\\n\\n“It doesn’t mean being a wimp, sitting around playing the lute. Back in the old days you had the right to mete out justice and put people to death; I’m glad that bit’s changed.”\\n\\nWhile modern riders like their horses tall and rangy, Kingsley seeks out burlier breeds. “War horses were very particular beasts,” he says. “They weren’t the type of horse you’d ride to market. They were as specialist as a tank and about as expensive.”\\n\\nAnd the discipline of horse dressage has its roots in battle tactics, he says. “On the battlefield, your horse becomes your own feet; you need that control to be able to fight. So when you get your horse to go forwards at an oblique angle – sideways – that’s so you can better strike with your sword. Medieval battles were grisly affairs. It’s a rather dark and macabre basis for a beautiful sport.”\\n\\nHorse play: Jason rides stallions as they are more aggressive Credit: Kasumi Kitano\\n\\nHe often winces when he sees historical dramas. “The types of horses they use are often wrong, the armour they wear – often full of gaps where a rider could get injured.” Kingsley rides stallions, which are more aggressive than geldings or mares.\\n\\n“They’re harder to control, they’re more powerful and usually have a strong opinion of how brilliant they are. But when you’re riding into a dangerous situation, you want the fastest movers: the most agile, the most athletic.”\\n\\nAnd jousting is dangerous; as Kingsley says: “You’re not pretending to strike your opponents with a lance. You are actually striking them with a lance.” In medieval tournaments, knights would try and knock another off their horses, but it was a violent sport.\\n\\nEven today, enthusiasts have died during re-enactments, which are held regularly in the UK. Kingsley’s armour is not a costume, he insists, it’s the best safety equipment craftsmen of the era could come up with, and it must fit properly. He won’t joust unless both horses are clad in armour, too. But he’s not scared before a contest “in the same way that a rugby player doesn’t worry about breaking his or her neck”.\\n\\nMuddy fields and bucking stallions are a far cry from virtual reality and the world of computer games – so how does he reconcile his life at work and at play? “It’s all about imagination, getting drawn into a different world. I don’t think computer games – or virtual reality – are necessarily about shooting down the baddy. I think we’re at the threshold to some fantastic opportunities. But it won’t stop us experiencing real life.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur ancestors painted their cave walls with pictures of dancers. Even babies instinctively jig in time to music. Dancing feels good – and while some societies ban it, there is no culture on earth that doesn’t possess an urge to dance.\\n\\nBut how is it that such a simple physical act has the ability to lift the spirits? The reasons, say dance psychologist Dr Peter Lovatt of the University of Hertfordshire, are four-fold. “Dancing stimulates us physically and emotionally while there are also cognitive and social elements to it,” he explains.\\n\\n“You appear to get a much bigger release of endorphins when you dance than during other forms of exercise; it also connects with the emotional centres in the brain. For many people, dancing prompts an emotional release – often that’s uncomplicated happiness, while for some it can make them cry. It’s cathartic – a letting go of pent-up emotions.”\\n\\nExperiments have proved the cognitive benefits of dancing. University researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of people and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened or to get up and dance. All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after.\\n\\n“Dancing makes you feel good because it makes you feel so alive”\\n\\nDr Lovatt says: “All those who chose to dance displayed improved problem-solving skills afterwards. This same study also found that the mood levels of the dancers went up. It shows that dancing along to music even for five minutes can boost happiness and improve creative-thinking patterns.”\\n\\nDancing also improves spatial awareness, as well as raising the heart rate and causing a release of feel-good endorphins into the bloodstream. One more benefit is that it helps reduce levels of cortisol – a stress hormone. “That’s another reason why it makes you feel happy and more relaxed,” says fitness expert Matt Roots.\\n\\n“And as well as getting the heart and lungs pumping, there is the simple fact that dancing is all about freeing up the body and allowing it to move, which is something we tend to do too little of these days.\\n\\n“Modern living often leaves us feeling disconnected from our bodies, because we spend so much time sitting down and hooked up to technology. Dancing makes you feel good because it makes you feel so alive.”\\n\\nAnother big draw to dancing is the social element. “It’s scientifically proved that dancing helps with social bonding,” explains Dr Lovatt. “The synchrony involved in dancing to a beat along with other people is a powerful way for humans to connect.”\\n\\n“It is something you can enjoy at any point in your life, no matter what your ability”\\n\\nGinny Brown of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing agrees. “Dancing brings people into social space where they can work together on mutual enjoyable activity.\\n\\n“That element of interaction can be a wonderful starting point for getting to know people. You can walk into a dance class not knowing another soul, and quickly discover that dancing – at whatever level – is a wonderful way of breaking down inhibitions and encouraging positive interactions.\\n\\n“Young people have a wonderful time dancing spontaneously in nightclubs. Dance teachers often report that many of their students are retired couples looking for an activity that they can enjoy together and connect in a way that a round of golf simply doesn’t allow.\\n\\n“It is something you can enjoy at any point in your life, no matter what your ability – and the range of styles is phenomenal. Dancing makes us feel good because, above all, it’s such great fun.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

The shop aims to help raise funds for the centre and sells imaginative monster delicacies such as “human snot,” (honey) “fang floss” (string), and “cubed earwax” (vanilla fudge).\\n\\nChildren attending writing workshops enter through the store’s very own secret door to discover a bright and modern workshop concealed at the back.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Stories hosts a number of creative writing projects and workshops, thanks to a network of over 400 volunteers. It was founded just over five years ago when Lucy Macnab, Ben Payne and best-selling author Nick Hornby set out to create an inspiring writing centre for children, that they could access completely free of charge.\\n\\n“Through a range of innovative writing programmes, and one-to-one mentoring, we help young people discover and realise their own creative potential,” says Ms Macnab. “We build confidence, self-respect and communication skills in both workshops for schools and out-of-school writing clubs.”\\n\\nNmeso, aged 10 has benefited greatly from his time at the Ministry of Stories. He attends a weekly after-school club that helps to grow his imagination and develop his writing. “Writing club can open your ideas up,” says Nmeso. “It’s a place where you can write or create anything you want to. Writing is better than just texting. The way you write can show people how you feel.”\\n\\nNmeso believes his time at the Ministry of Stories has made him calmer and more responsible, helping him to move up a level in school and become head boy. Along with other young writers at the Ministry, Nmeso has had his own story, Andre has a Hard Time, published. It’s a technique his mother thinks is significant.\\n\\n“Storytelling is incredible whether you become a writer or not, it’s a great way to express your emotions”\\n\\n“At this age, to have a book in his name, that is a big achievement,” she says. “When he gets to secondary school, he can always look back on that achievement. The foundation is laid.”\\n\\nLast year, the Ministry of Stories celebrated its fifth birthday and won the National Lottery award for the best arts project, via public vote. This helped realise a range of new projects such as the opening of a second writing centre in Rotherham, Grimm & Co. “Grimm & Co is a writing centre just like ours, fronted by an apothecary for magical beings,” explains Ms Macnab.\\n\\nOne of the Ministry’s key milestones this year involved children from the centre’s associate school, the Bridge Academy, visiting Parliament to deliver speeches to an audience of MPs, speechwriters and decision makers.\\n\\n“The children learned how to express what really mattered to them in compelling speeches over a 12-week project. They grew from a naturally shy group, to young people with the confidence to address a committee room at the heart of our government,” Ms Macnab says.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Stories is strongly supported by the literary world, and in particular Penguin Random House UK. A new series of panel events began last month at the publisher’s central London-based headquarters, and panellists Sophie Kinsella, Laura Dockrill and Charlie Higson were interviewed by three children in front of a live ticket-paying audience. The event is part of a series with children’s authors, and aims to share the magic of what happens when professional writers work with young people.\\n\\nThe write stuff: the Ministry of Stories gives children confidence in their abilities\\n\\n“I think storytelling is incredible whether you become a writer or not, it’s a great way to express your emotions, said Ms Kinsella at the event. “A lot of children don’t always have an outlet, so it’s a great way for them to try out their writing in a lovely environment. I would have loved it as a child”.\\n\\nAuthor Mr Higson believes the Ministry of Stories offers something that schools cannot. “The school system has become more and more restricted, and I think there’s a danger that it can actually put kids off books and reading,” he says. “The Ministry makes writing fun, and encourages children to use their imagination and creativity, without being told there’s a special way to write a story. I think it’s brilliant”.\\n\\nWith 2016 already getting off to flying start, what could be next for the Ministry of Stories and its legion of young storytellers?\\n\\nFirstly, it plans to work with other partners such as Grimm & Co to create more members of the Ministry of Stories family.\\n\\n“We’re also working on how we can make more of what we do accessible to more children online through innovative digital methods including online mentoring,” says Ms Macnab. “All of this requires a huge amount of support”.\\n\\nIf you would like to know more about the Ministry of Stories, become a volunteer or simply show your support, go to ministryofstories.org\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

The truth is you need to adapt your diet and lifestyle according to your age.\\n\\nAs we get older, we start to lose muscle mass. Those extra calories that you used to burn off will now make you fat.

Most of us don’t eat the recommended 30g of fibre a day and oily fish consumption is below the recommended 140g per week.\\n\\nWhite fish or tinned tuna are not a rich source of the omega-3 fats we need for healthy eyes, hearts and brains. We need to eat more mackerel, salmon and herring.\\n\\nEating seasonally\\n\\nTake advantage of the ebb and flow of seasonal produce to bring variety to your diet. Spring brings cauliflower, spinach, purple sprouting broccoli and kale, which is fantastic for eye health.

It’s in lots of vegetables as well as citrus fruits. Zinc is important too, for healthy skin, nails and hair. You’ll find it in red meat, nuts and seeds.\\n\\nLittle and often\\n\\nSmall changes make a big difference in the long term.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional stand-ups share the secrets of joke-telling – including, crucially, how not to mess it up\\n\\nAnyone can tell a joke, right?\\n\\nImagine you have just seen Jimmy Carr on the television or Miranda Hart in her live show telling a hilarious gag. Come the next day, back in the office or the pub that evening, you try retelling it to your mates.\\n\\nBut hang on, how did it start again? “No, sorry, that’s the punchline. Pretend you didn’t hear that. OK, got it now, there were these two men – no three women – in an airport. Sorry, on their way to an airport…”\\n\\nDoes that sound familiar? Joke-telling is harder than it looks. Some of us think we just don’t have the knack. But that’s not true. Happily, there are a few simple tricks that professional stand-ups employ which can improve your joke-telling quicker than a Tim Vine one-liner.\\n\\n“Before you tell a joke, even to friends, it’s a good idea to know your audience,” says Dr Oliver Double a former full-time comedian who now lectures on comedy at the University of Kent and has written the book, Getting the Joke: The Inner Workings of Stand-Up Comedy.\\n\\n“Professional stand-ups do this, and you should too. Telling a real lads’ joke to a group of older women at work might not go down well.”\\n\\nDon’t tell a gag when everyone is putting their drinks order in. Pick a time that will have the most impact\\n\\nAward-winning comedian and comedy writer Stephen Grant agrees, and adds that you should know where your joke’s going.\\n\\n“The reason why we like snappy jokes is because there’s a lot less time listening to the ‘set up’,” says Mr Grant. “So if you’re going to say something that’s only moderately funny, make sure the set-up is short. It’s painful listening to joke that’s ten minutes long when the punchline could have been said after a minute.”\\n\\nJokes are often funnier if you rehearse them, even if it’s only in your head, says Kevin McCarron. He’s a compere at the Laughing Horse Comedy clubs across the UK, and also teaches comedy at the University of Roehampton where he is a lecturer.\\n\\n“Lots of people think they tell jokes badly but that’s probably because they don’t rehearse them,” says Mr McCarron. “They launch straight into them and a third of the way through remember they’ve forgotten something.\\n\\n“By practising the joke to yourself or others, you can often improve it. You’re not committed to retelling a joke exactly the same way you were first told it. You can make it funnier each time. “\\n\\nTelling a good joke will not only make you appear as a wag, but also improve your confidence, your public speaking skills and, with all that laughter flowing back your way, your own ‘feel-good’ factor too” he adds.\\n\\nHere the experts share their tips for maximum laughs:\\n\\nChoose the moment\\n\\n“Don’t tell a gag when everyone is putting their drinks order in,” says Mr McCarron. “Pick a time that will have the most impact.”\\n\\nDon’t undersell your joke\\n\\n“Don’t play it down by saying half way through the gag: ‘actually, this isn’t very funny’,” says Mr Grant.\\n\\nDon’t oversell your joke\\n\\n“Telling me ‘you’re going to love this’ immediately makes me resistant to liking it,” says Mr McCarron.\\n\\nTiming\\n\\n“A joke has a natural rhythm,” says Dr Double. “If the punchline demands a pause, pause. And don’t tread on a laugh either, which occurs when the next line is lost because the audience are still laughing at the previous one.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn overland trip through Africa has created a lasting legacy for one adventurous couple\\n\\nMany people dream of jacking in their jobs and heading off on a great adventure. But how many of us have the gumption to actually do it? More importantly, how many would raise thousands of pounds for charity and get involved in all manner of humanitarian and conservation projects as part of the experience?\\n\\nThat’s exactly what newlyweds James and Mira Raley did, during an extended honeymoon that saw them drive a 4x4 through Africa and take in some of the world’s most beautiful and inhospitable terrain as part of a once-in-a-lifetime trip.\\n\\nHoneymooning adventurously\\n\\n“Long before we were married, Mira and I discussed our love of travel and adventure,” explains James Raley, who served for six years with the Coldstream Guards before pursuing a corporate career in the UAE.\\n\\nKiss me quick: James Raley enjoys an encounter with an emu\\n\\n“We often romanticised about a big trip, and agreed that Africa was the continent that intrigued us the most.”\\n\\nEven so, the young couple felt they might be nurturing something of a pipe dream. After all, they were both establishing themselves professionally, and trips to Africa don’t come cheap. “I had assumed our aspirations would never materialise due to my need for financial security and career progression,” James remarks. “But a few months before we got married, Mira sent out a wedding gift list that consisted of adventurous activities in Africa. So our fate was sealed.”\\n\\nIt’s just this sort of bold thinking that makes dreams come true. But there was still a lot of planning needed before the Raleys could head off, which is why there was a nine-month hiatus between their wedding day and the start of the journey.\\n\\nThe trip to Africa left us with a wealth of memories that no salary could replace\\n\\n“It actually took us about 18 months in total to plan the trip,” reports Mrs Raley. “We spent a lot of time on the internet researching routes and reading blogs by people travelling through Africa. We also took our time over preparing the car for overland use. There was a lot of trial and error as we sought the best set-up for our needs.”\\n\\nIt is a testament to the couple’s tenacity that they held fast to their vision. A further test of resolve came just a few months before heading off, when James was offered a tempting employment opportunity. “We contemplated if he should take the job,” says Mira. “But our plans were so well advanced that we knew we’d always regret it if we didn’t put them into action.”\\n\\nThat turned out to be a very good decision, as James reports. “The trip left us with a wealth of memories that no salary could replace. For example, we loved watching the dancing at the Lake Turkana Festival in Kenya, and sitting alongside the gelada baboons in the Simien Mountains in Ethiopia was another highlight.”\\n\\n“We were also privileged to watch the great migration in the Masai Mara, Kenya,” adds Mira. “Plus we climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, and dived with manta rays and humpback whales in Mozambique, and with sharks in Cape Town.”\\n\\nGiving something back\\n\\nWhile these experiences ensured the trip was punctuated by fantastic memories, James and Mira are quick to observe that the real sense of achievement comes from its charitable dimension. They offered hands-on support to a variety of causes en route, including a local community project in a village in Zanzibar, where they helped out at a nursery school, and the groundbreaking African Lion Rehabilitation Programme in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nHot wheels: the Raleys' modes of transport in Mozambique\\n\\nIn addition, the couple raised nearly $19,000 in sponsorship, which has helped a number of African projects including an orphanage and a community school. “We’d like to get that total to $50,000,” says Mira, “because we see that as a fitting legacy for our adventure.”\\n\\nAs it turns out, this is just one of the ways the couple’s African experience has left its mark. Their son, Toby, was conceived in a remote campsite in Botswana and is now three months old.\\n\\n“He’s a constant reminder of a fantastic period in our lives,” concludes James. “It taught us that, sometimes, taking a small risk and getting out of your comfort zone can open incredibly exciting doors that would otherwise remain closed.”\\n\\nSo far as lessons to learn on your honeymoon go, that doesn’t seem a bad place to start. Especially when so many other people have benefited from your experience, too.\\n\\nFind out more\\n\\nRead about the Raleys’ trip at thehoneybadgerdiaries.com or donate to their fund at gofundme.com/thehoneybadgerdiaries\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

There is nothing more fulfilling than making someone smile,” says founder Maria Ahern.\\n\\nWith such a positive ethos at its heart, it’s hard to comprehend that it was born from a tragedy. The foundation was set up 18 months ago, shortly after the tragic death of Maria’s 22-year-old son James.\\n\\nAfter his death, James’s parents Maria and Terry Ahern began to learn just how much of an impact their young son had made on the people in his life and community. It was this positive message that they wanted to capture in an organisation that supports young people.\\n\\n“Our slogan is ‘enabling the pursuit of passion’ because everything that James did, he did with passion,” explains Maria. “James was all too aware that he had gifts and privileges that are denied to so many, and he was always keen to share these gifts. At the foundation we want to be able to reach those young people who may need support, encouragement, mentorship, or just a helping hand, to achieve their goals and their passions,” she continues.\\n\\nWhen I was accepted for a grant, it felt so surreal and I can't put into words how happy I am now\\n\\nOnly at the beginning of its story, the foundation has already helped realise many dreams and aspirations. The organisation works on the principle that if it can help, it will, with no request considered too grand or too small.\\n\\nA grant was recently given to an 18-year-old girl who needed singing lessons so she could pursue a career in the performing arts. Requests from a budding student with a dream to study law in America, to a youth cricket club in need of a new lawn mower for their pitch, are pending acceptance.\\n\\nThe foundation’s first-ever grant was a pledge to an 18-year-old girl named Georga Knight, who was passionate about football. “My dream has always been to make it as a professional footballer and to learn and train in America where the sport is so big,” says Georga.\\n\\n“I didn't ever think that it would be possible until I heard about The James Ahern foundation. When I was accepted for a grant, it felt so surreal and I can't put into words how happy I am now. The foundation has given me the opportunity to go to America where I plan to play and coach with a professional team”.\\n\\nAdditionally, the foundation works alongside other charities to help its good work go that little bit further. Last year, it purchased a number of sleeping bags and shoes for the homeless that were distributed by another small charity. It also gave a grant to a small charity who took a group of young children on a trip to a farm for some respite recreation.\\n\\nEvery person that accepts a grant is encouraged to continue using their time to help other young people\\n\\n“We think that this part of our work is equally important as it enables small charities to help each other and to reach more people,” says Maria.\\n\\nEvery person that accepts a grant is encouraged to continue using their time to help other young people. This way, the foundation hopes to grow exponentially while allowing those that receive grants to take pride in their own contribution and achievements. “We want to encourage those that have to share with those that don’t,” says Maria.\\n\\nMusic concerts, quiz nights and providing food for the homeless are just a few ways that the foundation works within the community and raises money for new grant applications.\\n\\nWith the help of the hashtag #JamieKiss, the foundation’s goodwill message is going global. Supporters are asked to share photos of themselves wherever there are, and the response has been phenomenal. Snaps have come from all over the world, from the tops of mountains and ski slopes, to waterfalls and weddings.\\n\\n“It's hard to be sad when you are blowing a kiss to the world,” says Maria. “And we hope that the Jamie Kiss will become a symbol of kindness and positivity”.\\n\\nFor more information on The James Ahern foundation, go to jamesahernfoundation.org or keep up to date with fundraising events by following @JamesAhernFndtn on Twitter\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

Finn will sit under their desk, or if we’re out on a school trip in the minibus, lay his head on their lap so they can stroke him during the journey. Because he’s so gentle, even children who are scared of dogs quickly get used to him.\\n\\n“Many of the children say Finn makes coming to school fun. Even when they move on, they often keep in touch and want to know how he is.”\\n\\nStudents, accompanied by a staff member, are allowed to walk Finn as a reward. But spending time with him can also help in stressful situations, says Eileen, who has been the school’s head for three years.\\n\\n“If a child is upset or angry, I often suggest they take Finn for a walk. By the time they return, they’ve calmed down and they’re over it.\\n\\n“He sits in my office, so hears all my conversations and he knows everything that goes on in this school. Finn will also sit by a child on the playground bench if they want to simply talk. He listens as they stroke him and confide in him.\\n\\n“Because some of our children live in care homes, they can’t have their own pet, so Finn fills that gap for them. It also makes them responsible for others. If I tell them Finn needs his water bowl filling, they’ll sort it out immediately.\\n\\n“Lots of our children experience many changes in their young lives, but at school Finn is a constant and he’s always there for them.”\\n\\n• To find out more about the Together Trust, visit www.togethertrust.org.uk\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWidow Sheila Young wasn’t keen on the idea of online dating. But she took the plunge and met a man who changed her life.\\n\\nIt took courage and a couple of glasses of wine for widow Sheila Young to try online dating. Sheila, 73, had lost her husband to bowel cancer 18 months earlier.\\n\\nAfter more than 40 years of marriage, she was bereft. She missed the companionship, conversation and comfort of having someone to share her life.\\n\\n“A niece had tried online dating,” says Sheila. “It didn’t work for her, but I kept seeing adverts on the telly and thought, maybe... Then one evening I had a couple of glasses of red wine and thought, ‘go for it girl’. I didn’t tell anyone in case it didn’t work out. I said in my profile simply, ‘I want someone to make me laugh again’.”\\n\\nSheila missed the companionship, conversation and comfort of having someone\\n\\nOver a period of three weeks, her inbox filled with inappropriate messages from younger men and a kind offer from a ninety-something gentleman who “seemed to be looking for a housekeeper’’.\\n\\nSheila despaired. Then she found Roy Millard, 75. Or rather, he found her. Roy, whose wife Jenny died of ovarian cancer seven years ago, signed up to the dating site without telling a soul.\\n\\n“At our age you go to the same places and see the same people, so how do you meet anyone new?” says Roy. “Friends would invite me to dinner and I’d always end up with an empty chair opposite, as everyone was seated in couples. It makes you feel awful.\\n\\n“Filling in the forms was really awkward. I didn’t know what to say. But I persevered.”\\n\\nLike Sheila, Roy was looking for a companion. Someone to giggle with, to laugh at his jokes. Living 32 miles apart – Sheila in Birmingham and Roy in Leicestershire – they were perfect for each other.\\n\\nWe plucked up the courage to do something, and it worked out\\n\\nBut because Sheila had limited her search to a 20-mile radius, Roy’s profile never appeared. Then, fed up with disappointing dates, Roy widened his own search. When Sheila’s photograph popped up, he stopped short. He was smitten.\\n\\nLuckily, Sheila liked the look of him too. “It was his eyes, I think,” she says. “Such a twinkle in them.”\\n\\nAfter three weeks of messaging and talking on the phone, the pair arranged to meet halfway at a garden centre in October 2012.\\n\\nWhen Sheila pulled in, Roy was already waiting by his car. “We were both nervous,” admits Sheila. “But once we sat down for a coffee, it just felt natural.\\n\\n“I had told my daughter, Catherine, about the meeting and she telephoned to check that everything was OK. Roy answered the phone and joked, ‘Your mum’s fine. I have tied her to the chair so she won’t run away.’ Afterwards, Catherine chuckled to me, ‘You’ll be all right with that one, mum.’”\\n\\nSheila has barely stopped laughing since the day they met\\n\\nRoy adds: “Neither of us wanted the date to end, so we drove to a pub for lunch. It was magnetism.”\\n\\nSoon they met each other’s families, including Roy’s two daughters Alison and Amanda, Sheila’s children Catherine and Simon and a total of seven grandchildren.“I was worried how they would react, whether they would think I was being disloyal to their dad in some way,” admits Sheila. “I didn’t tell them about the online dating until I found Roy.\\n\\n“But they were so happy for me. Both families get on well. We both had lots of great friends and family, and now they are combined. It’s lovely.”\\n\\nAfter splitting their time between two homes, the couple decided to get their own place. They chose Atherstone, Warwickshire because it was convenient for both families, and moved into an apartment in a McCarthy & Stone retirement development last May.\\n\\nWith visits from friends and family, eating out regularly and recent holidays to Barbados and the Aegean coast, the couple are rarely at home.\\n\\nWe’re a team. And we have never argued\\n\\nWhen they are, it’s the little things they treasure about living together. “Sometimes it’s as simple as watching a television programme and, when you want to comment on it, there’s somebody there to listen,” says Sheila. “I really missed that when my husband had gone.”\\n\\nAnd both agree that it’s nice to have someone to share the cooking duties. “Most days I make lunch and Sheila makes dinner,” adds Roy. “We’re a team. And we have never argued. Mainly because I just give in all the time.” Sheila certainly found what she was looking for – someone to make her laugh again. In fact, she admits, she has barely stopped laughing since the day they met.\\n\\n“I can’t believe that my life has changed so much,” she says. “When I think of people in my situation being lonely, I feel so lucky.”\\n\\nRoy adds: “We plucked up the courage to do something, and it worked out. Look at the life we have now.”\\n\\nTop tips for online dating\\n\\nPick the right site\\n\\nSome dating sites cater for more mature daters, while others draw a younger crowd. Telegraph Dating, for example, is a great choice for over-40s. Take time to find the one for you.\\n\\nAsk for help\\n\\nDescribing yourself can feel awkward, so enlist loved ones when writing a profile to identify traits that make you a catch.\\n\\nBe specific\\n\\nList plenty of facts about your interests on the profile to increase the chances of finding a compatible mate.\\n\\nMeet in public\\n\\nIn the interests of safety, arrange your first meeting at a busy spot and make your own transport arrangements.\\n\\nEnjoy it\\n\\nYou may not fall in love, but you could meet new friends – and at least get some good stories to share.\\n\\nDo kids know more about love than adults?\\n\\nWe asked an adorable group of children about the meaning of love.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMissing the morning commute? Not a chance. For Louise Dumayne and her husband Neil, leaving London for the remote Yukon Territory in northern Canada was the best decision they ever made.\\n\\nFollowing a wolf track up a creek thousands of miles from civilisation on a crisp, clear, -27C Sunday might not be everyone’s idea of fun, but for Louise Dumayne, 45, and her husband Neil, 47, it’s the epitome of more than a decade’s worth of hard work and planning.\\n\\nSwapping London for Yukon: Louise and Neil couldn't be happier\\n\\n“I’d always been fascinated with living in a log cabin in the middle of the snow since I was a little girl,” says Louise from their cabin in Canada’s Yukon Territory. “As I grew up it never went away, but life got in the way. I trained to be an actress, met Neil and my childhood dream seemed destined to stay as just that.”\\n\\nBut 13 years ago, Louise booked a holiday to Alaska that would change the course of her life forever. “It was everything I’d imagined, and I instantly fell in love with it,” she admits. “Neil came with me in 2009, and after that we kept going back… soon we were coming back to the UK to work and save so we could spend as much time as possible out there.”\\n\\nSeek out opportunities that take you closer to what you want to do or where you want to be\\n\\nHaving made friends and learned outdoor skills during their few month-long trips over the years, when the chance to buy a cabin in the Yukon Territory over the border from Canada came up last year, both Louise and Neil knew where their future lay. “The Yukon is almost 500,000sq km but most of the land is Queen’s Land or First Nations’ land,” says Louise. “There’s barely ever any land or property that doesn’t flood seasonally that comes up for sale. We managed to find a cabin in eight acres which was out of our budget. But thanks to the strong exchange rate, we were able to afford it.”\\n\\nLast October the couple started the trip to their new home. Louise travelled first to Vancouver then White Horse, and then used a snow machine to get to Dawson City and on north by northwest. “It took us a couple of months to get to the property because of the ice and snow and frozen rivers,” she says. “We were in a tent in -40C for a while as we made our way slowly towards it.”\\n\\nSelf-sufficient: the couple fetch their own water, cut their own firewood, and make their own paths\\n\\nDespite the fact the pair have only just started working on their cabin – which needs foundations – and an unusable trapper cabin, there’s not a second thought about whether they made the right decision.\\n\\n“When I first started visiting this part of the world I met a woman who’d built her own three-storey house with her sister,” recalls Louise. “I was astounded that people just did things. If they needed something built, they built it. We were very lucky. We learned such a lot through visiting and now, on a basic level, we can maintain ourselves.\\n\\nThis life is fulfilling in a way I wouldn’t swap for anything\\n\\n“Having said that, we’ve had some near misses. Neil was felling a tree and the chain came off the chainsaw, which could have sliced right through him. I rolled the snow machine with logs on the back and was lucky one flew over my head rather than into it.”\\n\\nDespite the adversities they face – and the fact most of their friends think they’re nuts – they’re living a dream many people wouldn’t dare have the courage to follow. “We asked ourselves at the beginning what the worst-case scenario would be if we gave it a go,” says Louise. “And we couldn’t come up with one that scared us enough not to try it. Our life here is so different to London. There we worked so hard for someone else to supply what we needed, whether that was paying a mechanic to fix the car or buying a loaf of bread from a shop. Here we work harder physically but we answer our own needs. We wake up, stoke the fire and get it going, then make bread. We fetch our own water, cut our own firewood, and make our own paths, crossing and trails.\\n\\n“It can be boring at times: hand-washing clothes instead of putting them in a machine loses its lustre pretty quickly. But this life is fulfilling in a way I wouldn’t swap for anything.”\\n\\nFor anyone wishing they could swap snowshoes with Louise, she has some clear advice: “Seek out opportunities that take you closer to what you want to do or where you want to be. When we were deciding whether to buy the cabin, we both thought about how we’d feel when we were 80 if we turned it down. It’s the old adage but we’d rather regret doing it than not doing it.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s nothing better for the mood than a spot of gardening. Is that really true, though? What with pests, weeds and aching knees, there’s a streak of black humour in the outdoor art. Here’s a selection of wise, witty and pithy words from people with mud under their nails...\\n\\n\\n\\n“I consider every plant hardy until I have killed it myself.”\\n\\nPolitician and botanist Sir Peter Smithers\\n\\n“A weed is a plant that has mastered every survival skill except for learning how to grow in rows.”\\n\\nAmerican columnist Doug Larson\\n\\n“If you have a garden and a library you have everything you need.”\\n\\nRoman philosopher Cicero\\n\\n“I plant daffodil bulbs about eight inches deep. I don’t use a ruler. As a married woman, I know perfectly well what six or eight inches looks like. This mental measurement makes planting time much more interesting than it might be otherwise.”\\n\\nAmerican TV gardener Cassandra Danz\\n\\n“You know you’re a hardcore gardener if you deadhead flowers in other people’s gardens.”\\n\\nWriter Sue Careless\\n\\n“The great French Marshal Lyautey once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree would not reach maturity for a hundred years. The marshall replied, ‘In that case there is no time to lose. Plant this afternoon!’”\\n\\nJohn F Kennedy\\n\\nKeen gardener: Rudyard Kipling, writer, and enemy of all weeds Credit: Corbis\\n\\n“Plant and your spouse plants with you. Weed and you weed alone.”\\n\\nCommonly attributed (somewhat unconvincingly) to philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau – who did write extensively about gardening\\n\\n“Hand-weeding is not the terrible drudgery that it is often made out to be. Some people find in it a kind of soothing monotony. It leaves their minds free to perfect the brilliant repartee with which they should have countered a relative’s latest example of unreasonableness.”\\n\\nChristopher Lloyd\\n\\n“Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made\\n\\nBy singing, ‘Oh how beautiful!’ and sitting in the shade\\n\\nWhile better men than we go out, and start their working lives\\n\\nBy grubbing weeds from garden paths with broken dinner knives.”\\n\\nRudyard Kipling\\n\\n“The soul cannot thrive in the absence of a garden. If you do not want paradise, you are not human. And if you are not human, you do not have a soul.”\\n\\nThomas More\\n\\n“Nature abhors a garden.”\\n\\nJournalist Michael Pollan\\n\\n“He made two or three peculiar observations; as when shewn the botanical garden: ‘Is not every garden a botanical garden?’”\\n\\nJames Boswell, on Samuel Johnson\\n\\n“Gardening requires lots of water – most of it in the form of perspiration.”\\n\\nCartoonist Lou Erickson\\n\\n“What a man needs in gardening is a cast-iron back, with a hinge in it.”\\n\\nAmerican essayist Charles Dudley Warner\\n\\n“There can be no other occupation like gardening in which, if you were to creep up behind someone at their work, you would find them smiling.”\\n\\nHorticulturalist Mirabel Osler\\n\\n“Weather means more when you have a garden. There is nothing like listening to a shower and thinking how it is sinking in around your green beans.”\\n\\nMarcelene Cox\\n\\n'With care my flowers tend': poet Robert Frost Credit: Time Life Pictures\\n\\n“The best way to make sure you are removing a weed and not a valuable plant is to pull on it.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not all sky writing and stalker-type behaviour - true romance comes in surprising places, says Jenny Colgan, author of Meet Me at the Cupcake Café\\n\\nOne of the most romantic things my boyfriend ever did was buy me a hammock and string it up on the tiny and dangerous roof terrace of my single-girl flat, back in those ancient days when you could buy flats by yourself.\\n\\nI used to lie in it in the sun, eating Quavers and reading and dreaming about my lovely handsome boyfriend.\\n\\nThen, reader, I married him and we had three children and a naughty dog, and moved to the country where it rains all the time and I haven’t had a pee on my own for nine years, and I think the hammock is in storage and this, my friends, is what I believe is known as “happily ever after”.\\n\\nSo, you know, being a romance novelist probably isn’t quite as romantic as people think it is. Falling in love is one of the most wonderful feelings on Earth, and writing about it is nothing but a privilege. I will tell you that I always write the first meeting scene and the first kissing scene early on in a book, I just love doing them so much. But I think we know there’s a difference.\\n\\n“I found the oddest thing about Fifty Shades wasn’t the spanking: it was the way Christian kept turning up unannounced”\\n\\nI was being interviewed once when the journalist asked me: “Do you think it’s fair to give women unrealistic expectations of romance based on your novels?” and I narrowed my eyes crossly at her and said: “Do you think Ian Rankin gives people unrealistic expectations of how likely they are to be horribly murdered in Edinburgh?” (And then I smiled and pretended I was joking so she wouldn’t hate me, because I’m like that.)\\n\\nIn fact it gets a little worse than that; some of the things that happen in romantic novels and films – like running through airports and holding up signs – I think would be really creepy in real life, so, although I might have written the occasional passionate reconciliation, I’m very wary about anything that remotely hints of stalker. I found the oddest thing about Fifty Shades wasn’t the spanking: it was the way Christian kept turning up unannounced.\\n\\nYou might think I’d be wise in the ways of romance after writing 25 romantic novels, but let me tell you, I got there the same way as everybody else: dating a gigantic line of the most tremendous wingbats until I met a nice one, then clinging on to him for dear life.\\n\\nBut here is what I do know: The one thing my heroines often have in common is going to a new place and getting stuck in. I met my husband when I was on a girls’ holiday, struck up a conversation with some other girls and accepted their invitation to a boat party. I walked on board and there he was. I thought he was the barman, then found out he was the engineer. He thought it was amazing to meet a girl who was really interested in marine engineering (haha, sorry).\\n\\nSaying yes to invitations - even if it’s just to look at an engine room - is just simple statistics. The odds will inevitably stack up in your favour. Like so many other things in life, the trick is often just in showing up.\\n\\n“All the little things that bring you joy are the only things that matter in the end”\\n\\nThe other thing I always write is a capable heroine doing her own thing. Mine are busy getting on with their lives and making themselves happy on their own terms (and only sometimes glancing around in case there are any hot available vets because, you know, we’re only human). It works in the books because it works in life too.\\n\\nAnd trust a romantic novelist on this: never fall for a man who isn’t nice to dogs. And try not to fall for a man who is only nice to dogs, but I can’t promise that’s possible. And romance often isn’t a Valentine’s Day meal for two along with lots of other anxious-looking couples (although that’s fine too). Sometimes it’s just someone putting the laundry away. Or managing to fit in a quick pint while your daughter’s at her dance class. It’s a wink at a party. A squeeze in the car. The little things.\\n\\nSo now I am going to tell you the most romantic thing that has ever happened to me, even though it is totally disgusting and would never ever make it into my novels (maybe turn away at this point if you’re eating)… my husband had a vasectomy after our third baby.\\n\\n“What about that new young wife you’re going to leave me for when my chin finally does what it’s been threatening to all along and hits my shoes?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Yeah, she’s just going to have to lump it,” he said, cheerily.\\n\\nSo let romance, be for you, whatever makes you happy in life; all the little things that bring you joy are the only things that matter in the end.\\n\\nA kind word and a cup of tea are worth a lot of sky writing and grand gestures that cover up bad behaviour. Because we’re not stupid: we all know that romance novels are romance novels, and love is love; they are quite different, they are both wonderful, and I wish you oodles of both.\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood news comes in many forms, but perhaps the most heartwarming stories are when people do good deeds for strangers, simply because it feels good. Here are seven tales of unprompted kindness to bring a lump to the throat…\\n\\n\\n\\nOne good turn deserves another\\n\\nBoston court clerk Glen James had a run of bad luck in 2005 which led to his losing his job and then his home. Not wanting to be a burden on his relatives, he spent seven years living on the street and in shelters. Then he found a backpack containing travellers’ cheques and cash amounting to more than $40,000 (£28,000).\\n\\nHomeless hero: a selfless act turned Glen James\\'s life around Credit: The Boston Globe\\n\\nRather than keep what would be a life-changing windfall, James handed it all to police. They returned it to the grateful owner and the story of the “good Samaritan” was reported in the local press.\\n\\nReading about James’s good deed, stranger Ethan Whittington set up a GoFundMe page to raise a reward. Donations flooded in from around the world, eventually raising more than $100,000 - enough for James to get his life back on track.\\n\\nSpeaking to the press, James said that it was “nice to have some money in my pocket” and that even if he had been desperate, he wouldn’t have kept so much as a penny of the cash he found.\\n\\nThe true meaning of charity\\n\\nWelshman Dan Black was badly injured in a cycling accident. In 2013 he was raising money to fund a stem cell operation that might help him to walk again. Then he heard about five year-old Brecon Vaughan, who suffers from cerebral palsy and had only ever walked with the aid of a frame.\\n\\nWalking tall: Brecon Vaughan, thanks to Dan Black Credit: SWNS Group\\n\\nBrecon’s parents were raising funds for a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy to help their son walk unaided.\\n\\nBlack gave the entire £22,000 he had raised to Brecon, who flew to America for the procedure and today walks to school and plays with friends – thanks to the remarkable generosity of this 27-year-old stranger.\\n\\n“I wanted to help someone whose life could get better,” Black said at the time. “Hearing that Brecon was finally walking was lovely. It made giving the money away worth it.”\\n\\nWarm welcome for cold pups\\n\\nDavid Simonian was passing the Hott Spott café in Mytilene on the Greek island of Lesbos one night when he noticed a remarkable sight. Lit by the lights of a Christmas tree, four stray dogs were sleeping on the warm seats of the empty eatery. The photo he took went viral. Here’s why.\\n\\nPuppy love: abandoned dogs sleeping in the Hott Spott café\\n\\nAs a waiter later explained, since the financial crisis caused widespread unemployment in Greece, many people can no longer afford to feed their pets. Large numbers of tame dogs roam the streets. The café’s owners couldn’t bear to see them shivering through cold nights alone at Christmas, so they let them in.\\n\\n“When the café closes at 3am, the dogs come in to sleep,” the waiter explained. “The customers don’t mind. Every night there’s a dog on the couch.”\\n\\nReal love on Valentine’s Day\\n\\nIn the run up to 14 February 2012, London publican Nick Gibson realised that, for people not in happy relationships, Valentine’s Day wasn’t so cheerful. He wanted to do something good for them.\\n\\nSharing the love: the annual Valentine\\'s Day appeal at The Drapers Arms\\n\\nAnd so Gibson wrote an announcement on the pub blackboard: all his takings on Valentine’s Day would be donated to the charity Refuge. Since then he has repeated the donation each year, with the message spreading on social media.\\n\\nSo famous is his annual act of generosity that this Valentine’s Day was one of the busiest Sundays ever at his pub, The Drapers Arms in Islington. Gibson was able to present Refuge with a cheque for nearly £10,000.\\n\\n“I hope you’ll forgive a tiny sense of relief that next Valentine’s Day is a Monday!” Gibson wrote on social media. He intends to keep up the tradition – an example of a community pub genuinely taking care of people.\\n\\nWe will remember them\\n\\nHarold Percival was 99 when he passed away peacefully in the Alistre Lodge nursing home on the Lancashire coast. With only a few distant relatives, it seemed likely Percival’s funeral would be attended by almost no-one.\\n\\nA hero\\'s send-off: mourners at the funeral of Dambuster Harold Percival Credit: Getty\\n\\nThe home placed a small ad in the local paper mentioning that Percival had served in 617 Squadron, the Dambusters, and asking for strangers to be kind enough to attend. A retired policeman saw the ad and put it on social media. Celebrities including Jason Manford helped to spread the word. By the time the funeral was held – poignantly, at 11 o’clock on Armistice Day – there were hundreds of mourners including serving RAF and US Air Force airmen, soldiers and members of the Royal British Legion. Percival’s casket was preceded by a guard of honour.\\n\\n“You have come in numbers surpassing anything that was expected,” the Rev Alan Clark told the swelling congregation. “Not because you knew him, but because each of us has a common humanity.”\\n\\nThanks be for the coupon kid\\n\\nClipping coupons for discount groceries is not usually among a teenager’s priorities, but Jordan Cox, of Brentwood in Essex, is not your usual 16-year-old. Cox’s single mother Debbie, 52, struggles on her NHS administrator’s salary and her son’s tireless coupon-finding efforts cut around £2,000 from her annual grocery bill. It was while planning their Christmas shop that Jordan – who is studying business and finance – hatched a plan to help families other than his own.\\n\\nSaving the day: Jordan Cox and his Christmas coupons Credit: Rex\\n\\n“I decided I wanted to help as many people as I could, and to also show that it\\'s possible to shop very cheaply if you know how,” Cox said.\\n\\nHe took 470 assiduously collected coupons to his local Tesco and filled three shopping trolleys with discount food including chicken, stuffing, Yorkshire puddings, cheese and desserts. “It\\'s not an exact science, so you can never really work out ahead of time how much the total is going to be. I was stunned when it came up as just 4p.” That’s a saving of £572.12. Cox then donated the contents of all three trolleys to the charity Doorstep, which provides food to disadvantaged families.\\n\\n“\"I\\'d call his gift a great and generous act of a young man,” says Doorstep’s Vicky Fox. “He\\'s made a real difference to families who work with us who survive on extremely low incomes and do need the help.”\\n\\nThe best bequest\\n\\nTotnes-born RAF pilot Keith Owen had travelled the world and settled down in Canada, but always loved to visit Sidmouth in Devon, where his mother had retired. Owen’s favourite view was of the picturesque Sid valley leading down to the sea.\\n\\nA host of golden daffodils: Keith Owen\\'s bequest to Sidmouth Credit: SWNS Group\\n\\nHaving no children, when the time came to make a will Owen decided to do something for the town he loved and left his entire estate to the Sid Vale Association – the UK’s oldest civic society, asking them to plant flowers in the valley when he was gone.\\n\\nWhat made this news? Having followed his RAF days with a successful career in investment banking, Owen left the town he loved £2.3 million.\\n\\nSo far more than 400,000 bulbs have been planted by Sidmouth residents aged from two to 90. Since the entire scheme is paid for out of the interest on the £2.3 million, leaving the principal investment untouched, it’s a gift that will keep on giving.\\n\\n“One million flowers was Keith’s amazing dream,” says the head planter John Townsend. “We’re doing our best to fulfil his wish.”\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPupils at Sherborne School are getting their own taste of the rock-star experience thanks to an annual music festival\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat teenage boy hasn’t longed for the thrill of performing on the main stage at a music festival? Pupils at Sherborne School in Dorset have found a way to experience the bright lights and rocking atmosphere for themselves.\\n\\nEach year since the mid-Nineties, the boys’ boarding school has held its own festival in the heart of its historic grounds, with the proceeds being donated to charity.\\n\\nThe event is known as Concert in the Courts, and takes place on the school’s quadrangle (known as the Courts), against the backdrop of Sherborne’s famous abbey and the school’s own chapel.\\n\\n“It’s a pretty impressive venue,” reflects Sherborne’s director of music, James Henderson. “We set up a professional stage with proper lighting and sound engineers.\\n\\nSinging in particular is viewed as cool at Sherborne School, and that’s pretty unusual among teenage boys\\n\\nFor the bands that get a chance to perform, it feels every inch like a festival, right down to the 1,000-strong audience.\"\\n\\nThe town of Sherborne is a distinguished seat of learning, with a clutch of other independent schools and a thriving state school. Pupils from these neighbouring institutions are invited to audition for a place on the running order, and inter-school bands are commonplace.\\n\\nThis speaks of the popularity of music at Sherborne, and at the boys’ school in particular. That is thanks in no small part to the fact that it counts Coldplay frontman Chris Martin among its alumni.\\n\\nBut as Mr Henderson remarks, it is not just rock music that has benefited from this image boost. “Music, and singing in particular, is viewed as cool at Sherborne School, and that’s pretty unusual among teenage boys,” he observes. “Our pupils don’t tend to make a distinction between appearing in a rock band and singing in the chapel choir. To them, it’s all performance, and it is something they greatly enjoy.\"\\n\\nOpportunities to perform at Concert in the Courts do not come easily. Bands have to earn their place on the bill through a series of auditions organised by RocSoc, the school’s rock music society. The lucky few that make it through are given the opportunity to play a set of half a dozen songs at the annual extravaganza.\\n\\nUnited in song: inter-school bands are commonplace at Concert in the Courts\\n\\nIn addition to the current crop of performers, the organisers invite a headline act. This is usually a band that originated from the school, and is making waves in the music industry. “This year, we’ll be welcoming the three-piece act New Carnival, which has a growing fanbase nationally and formed at Sherborne,” reports Mr Henderson.\\n\\nSuch occasional sprinklings of stardust are well and good. But the standout feature of Concert in the Courts is that it’s very much a student-led initiative, not a spoon-fed taste of the world of professional music-making.\\n\\nThe original idea was sparked by from pupils, and they relish the opportunity to experience every aspect of organising, hosting and running a festival.\\n\\n“There are always lots of boys milling around backstage to learn from the sound and light technicians involved in the event,” says Mr Henderson. “As a result, when it comes to giving our other music events a professional feel, our pupils are well-versed in the full range of production skills.”\\n\\nThe same goes for the on-stage performers, who have a chance that many wannabe rock stars can only dream about. Someone who understands that only too well is music scholar Charlie Smith, who performed in the 2015 concert and hopes to do so again in 2016.\\n\\nChris Martin had better start looking over his shoulder. The next generation of Sherborne stars is ready to take the stage\\n\\n“I’m eager to have another Concert in the Courts experience,” explains the fifth-former. “It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.”\\n\\nThat is quite a claim, coming as it does from a young man who already has a Diploma from Trinity College London for his flute-playing. Mr Smith combines his interest in classical music with playing rock guitar, and says that he hopes to continue a family tradition of working as a professional musician.\\n\\n“My father is a folk musician,” he explains, “and it’s long been my ambition to make my living out of music. After I leave Sherborne, I hope to read music at university, and I’m keen to continue with both the flute and the guitar.”\\n\\nConcert in the Courts certainly gives pupils such as Mr Smith a taste of life on the stage. “From the auditions to the sound check in the afternoon before the show,” he says, “the whole experience is truly fantastic. It has really deepened my love of performing.”\\n\\nThat all sounds heart-warmingly positive, especially when you consider the charitable dimension of the event. And the altruism doesn’t end there, because Sherborne School works hard to share its passion for music and its first-rate facilities with other schools in the area.\\n\\n“For example,” says Mr Henderson, “we’re about to host an event for primary schools from Bristol to come and make music at Sherborne. Many of the boys who will take to the stage at Concert in the Courts are involved in this, because they’re eager to inspire others with a love of performing.”\\n\\nIt looks very much as if this school rock festival has benefits that far exceed the opportunity it provides for pupils to perform on a big stage. By engendering a deep appreciation of music throughout the community, and sharing that far and wide, it has all the hallmarks of a win-win situation.\\n\\nChris Martin had better start looking over his shoulder. The next generation of Sherborne music stars is ready to take the stage.\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf there’s one thing we all enjoy, it’s a decent love story. One that fills our hearts with the joy, hope and despair of human attraction. One that inspires us with wonderful characters and a gripping plot. One that we’ll read time and again, just to inhabit the author’s amazing world.\\n\\nBut how do you choose the best? It’s impossible to do so, of course, but that hasn’t stopped us trying. So, without further ado, sit back and enjoy our guide to the best love stories ever told.\\n\\n1. Romeo and Juliet, William Shakespeare\\n\\nOkay, so it’s a bit over-done nowadays. But that doesn’t detract from the ability of Shakespeare’s heartbreaking tale to tell us all we need to know about human longing. Sit before the star-crossed heroes at the play’s end, their arms entwined in a deathly embrace, and you see with utter clarity that true love is impossible to control. Then wipe your eyes and return to daily life, knowing that nothing will ever be the same again. No matter how clichéd it is to choose Romeo and Juliet as our winner, no other love story comes close.\\n\\n2. Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy\\n\\nSet against the panoramic backdrop of 19th-century Russia, Tolstoy’s tale operates at many levels. At its heart is the adulterous relationship between the title character and the dashing Count Vronsky. That doesn’t end well, with Anna throwing herself before a train and her suicidal lover heading off on a death mission to fight the Turks. But there’s a parallel romance for those who like their love stories less tragic: Anna’s sister-in-law’s sister Kitty eventually falls in love and marries the likeable Levin, who himself undergoes a journey of self-discovery that many critics regard as Tolstoy’s real purpose for writing Anna Karenina. Worthy of second place for sheer ambition alone.\\n\\nOne-hit wonder: Wuthering Heights Credit: Rex\\n\\n3. Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte\\n\\nHave you noticed the link between love and anguish? No one understood this better than Emily Bronte, whose one and only novel is an absolute corker. Heathcliff loves Cathy, and Cathy loves Heathcliff. But as with all good Victorian novels, class snobbery gets in the way of their passion. To cut a long story short, pretty much every character in the book ends up bitter, twisted and heartbroken. But the love never dies, and that’s what makes this a tale to be reckoned with.\\n\\n4. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen\\n\\nTalking of snobbery, Jane Austen’s deceptively comedic tale of Georgian manners is a masterclass in social commentary. At its heart is a good old-fashioned love story – or a few of them, to be precise. The most striking one is between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, whose relationship is established along the now-standard lines of initial coldness, mutual attraction, large-misunderstanding-that-leads-to-more-coldness, and eventual happily-ever-after-union. Too trope-filled to be the winner, Pride and Prejudice nevertheless deserves a place in our top five.\\n\\nCatholic tastes: The Thorn Birds Credit: Alamy\\n\\n5. The Thorn Birds, Colleen McCullough\\n\\nNo other book does longing like Colleen McCullough’s epic tale of ambitious Roman Catholic Priest Ralph’s forbidden love for one of his parishioners, Meggie. When the two eventually kiss, it is one of the most spine-tingling moments in literature. Sadly, there’s no happy ending, showing that love stories don’t always turn out how we want them to. Worthy of its place on our list for this reason alone, The Thorn Birds is distinguished by its readability, grand scope, and atmospheric Antipodean setting.\\n\\nDo kids know more about love than adults?\\n\\nWe asked an adorable group of children about the meaning of love.

What a great excuse to watch Ghost again.\\n\\nPhone a friend\\n\\nThey say a problem shared is a problem halved – and if you’re feeling like you’ve got the world on your shoulders, the best solution could come in the form of picking up the phone to a trusted friend.Talking over concerns or worries can alleviate feelings of anxiety, which in turn makes for a happier, more positive outlook on life.\\n\\nWake up happy\\n\\nNot getting enough shut-eye can have a real impact on your mood. Research from the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School showed that not sleeping enough (fewer than four hours per night) can lead to anxiety and lower levels of optimism.\\n\\nHowever you choose to get your quota of sleep, whether catnaps, power snoozes or a solid eight hours, you’ll wake up refreshed, revived and, most importantly, happy.\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Getty\\n\\nEat chocolate\\n\\nTreat yourself to a bar of chocolate when the going gets tough and feel the tension melt away. Yes, really. Chocolate contains phenylethylamine (PEA), which is the same chemical your brain creates when you feel like you’re falling in love, and it encourages the release of feel-good, happiness-inducing endorphins. Keep a bar in your bag for mood emergencies.\\n\\nPick the right colours\\n\\nThere’s something about wearing bright colours that makes you feel good, but they can also have an impact on your happiness. A study from the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) in Amsterdam discovered that adults felt happier when presented with objects in hues of yellow and green.\\n\\nMaybe it’s time to change up moody shades of blacks and greys for vivid yellows and vibrant greens and let your inner happiness shine through.\\n\\nRelax your mind\\n\\nMake time in your diary to switch off and find inner calm. Tuning out the noise of everyday life can bring great mental benefits and can contribute to feelings of contentment.\\n\\nA recent study found that after only eight weeks of meditating for about an hour each day, six days a week, subjects reported they had become happier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

They don’t cost a penny, they can make you feel good and might make your life a little more pleasant.\\n\\nHugging helps\\n\\nWho doesn't love a big old hug, especially when times are tough? There’s no doubt hugging or touching hands with friends and loved ones makes us feel better in difficult situations but it’s also scientifically proved to help reduce stress and ease pain. A study by scientists at the University of California revealed that the touch or sight of a loved one can reduce pain in times of distress. Who can argue with that?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood sleep equals good sex\\n\\nThere have been many studies on the health benefits associated with a good night’s sleep, and now there’s another great reason to get some quality shut-eye. A study by the University of Michigan Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory found women who get more sleep have higher sex drives and better sex. And with every additional hour of sleep, sexual desire rises and increases the likelihood of having sex with your partner by up to 14 per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChampagne improves your memory\\n\\nNeed another reason to pop the bubbly? It might seem counter-intuitive, but sipping the sparkling stuff might improve your mind. A recent trial at Reading University involved giving rats champagne every day for six weeks, then observing them complete a maze. Without drinking champagne, the rats had an average success rate in the maze of 50 per cent but that increased to 70 per cent post-bubbles. Cheers to that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChocolate can help you lose weight\\n\\nWe don’t need much convincing to reach for a chocolate treat, especially if it helps us in the health department. According to neuroscientist Will Clower, eating chocolate 20 minutes before and five minutes after lunch and dinner will help cut your appetite by up to 50 per cent, thanks to hormones the brain releases that fool the body into thinking it’s full. Hurrah!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaughter is the best medicine\\n\\nNot in the mood for a run? Don’t worry, just have a laugh instead. Believe it or not, laughter can do as much good for your body as a regular run, according to scientists. Hearty laughter is the equivalent to “internal jogging” because it can help to lower blood pressure, reduce stress and boost the immune system. Dr Lee Berk, from Loma Linda University in California, says: “The body’s response to repetitive laughter is similar to the effect of repetitive exercise. As the old biblical wisdom states, it may indeed be true that laughter is a good medicine.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDance yourself happy\\n\\nLove cutting some shapes on the dancefloor (or living-room carpet)? Research shows that there are myriad physical and emotional health benefits associated with dance. Helen Laws of Dance UK told the Telegraph: “It’s obviously a great way to burn calories, but dance also boosts self-confidence and has a positive impact on self-esteem. It’s also a free and fun way to make yourself happy.” It also beats the gym.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy. To that end, the Telegraph has teamed with Seven Seas to bring you uplifting, feel-good news stories each day. Take a few minutes to read something happy.

       "  'text': \"It's difficult to read the news without stumbling across the latest celebrity split or cheating scandal. Even in our own relationships, it can be easy to get wrapped up in the everyday rows and forget why you fell in love with your partner in the first place. If you find yourself focusing more on who’s winning your ongoing chores war and less on your partner’s favourable qualities, then it might be time for a quick refresher course on the true meaning of love. Luckily, we’ve found the perfect professors to deliver the lesson. They may not be able to see over the lectern, but they seem to have a firmer grasp on matters of the heart than many of we jaded adults.\\n\\n“Love is kindness,” explains seven-year-old Neriah, who joined a group of 16 London primary school children at a Valentine’s Day party hosted by the Telegraph. “It’s not about how you look, it’s about your personality.”\\n\\nStraight from the heart: this little lady knows what she wants when it comes to love Credit: Sam Robinson\\n\\nSix-year-old Sophie agrees. “It’s more important the way you look on the inside,” she says as she pours glitter onto the paper card she’s busy crafting. Pausing to take a break after his latest sugar-fuelled lap around the room, six-year-old Jake weighs in. “Love is what people really want to experience with people,” he says. “It’s like having someone to kiss and know for the rest of the days.”\\n\\nGoing into the day, I expected the girls to speak more freely when asked about the meaning of love – but I was surprised to find the boys’ responses to be just as endearing. For example, six-year-old Aron’s refreshing summary applies just as easily to grown-up dating as it does to children’s crushes. He says: “You play with each other and you see each other and it’s nice and it gets better and better, and then you fall in love.” His omniscient powers don’t stop there. When I ask him what type of gift he would buy a future girlfriend, he replies simply and wisely: “Whatever is on her list.”\\n\\nIt’s not about how you look. It’s about personality Neriah, age 7\\n\\nFor some of the kids, romance is simply something that happens to their mums and dads, aunts and uncles, and favourite Disney characters. But some of them are very much in love themselves – and are more than happy to share the details.\\n\\nAlice, seven, isn’t the least bit shy when it comes to the object of her affection. “We love each other and\\n\\nwe both know it,” she says, matter- of-factly. “He’s really clever and handsome. And he makes me laugh all the time.” But she’s quick to recognise that relationships don’t always go smoothly. “It can be sad because sometimes you can love someone and then you don’t love them, and then you do and then you don’t.”\\n\\nThe fickle nature of love is a truth that five-year-old Harley has already learned. “One day I liked a girl but she said to me that she found a different boyfriend. It made me feel quite sad,” he says. But don’t feel too sorry for Harley: he quickly moved onto Ava, another girl at school. “Ava, I’m pretty sure, is beautiful. She has a purple coat and she has orange hair, and she has a beautiful voice.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Joshua, six, only has eyes for his best friend, Ellie. But she has her sights set on someone else: “I made my Valentine’s card for my friend Caleb because I love him,” she says. “I’ve known him since I was born. He’s kind, he’s really nice, he doesn’t say naughty words. He’s handsome and he’s my best friend. Caleb wants to marry me. He said, ‘Can I marry you?’ And I said yes. For our wedding, I think he would wear comfy clothes, and I would wear a pretty wedding dress.”\\n\\nLove is what people really want to experience with people Jake, age 6\\n\\nSome of the other kids are not even close to thinking about settling down – especially if it involves kissing. “Actually, I really hate love,” Harley reveals – just moments after exalting Ava. “And do you want to know why? Because I really don’t like kissing.” (Cue 60 seconds of him mock spitting in disgust, making his point in the most adorable way possible.)\\n\\nHe’s not completely averse to the idea of tying the knot someday – but he (like many adult men) plans to put it off as long as possible. “I really think that I’m going to be 303.” He’s not the only one to deem passing the centenarian mark as a requirement for love. Neriah reckons she’ll wait until she’s at least 1,000, whereas Jake sums it up quite bluntly, telling me: “I’ll wait until I’m old like you.”\\n\\nMatters of the heart: love is simple to these children Credit: Sam Robinson\\n\\nOthers, however, seem to have a more concrete plan in place. “I’m going to get a proper boyfriend at 19 and then get married at 21,” says Alice. Aron has a slightly more relaxed timeline, declaring he will “fall in love at 32 and get married at 38”. While they may be a few decades away from experiencing romantic love, these kids certainly know what it means to have loving feelings for their friends and family. And they’re quick to extrapolate that affection to express their thoughts on grown-up love.\\n\\nGene, for one, seems to have a pretty strong grasp on the topic, and he knows what type of person he wants to end up with as an adult: “Someone nice and careful and happy.” The precocious seven-year-old – who’s dressed to impress in a sharp tweed jacket and poloneck – has already planned out his ideal date night. He’ll take his true love to St Paul’s Cathedral, he says promptly, as if it’s the most obvious question he’s ever been asked. And how will he know when he’s found the right person? “When they do good things for me and I do good things for them.”\\n\\nWhile the children are happy to wax lyrical about their future spouses, they’re just as happy to chase balloons around the room and pour glitter on each other’s heads. At this age, love equates to friendship – and for them, the rules of friendship are simple: be nice, share and don’t say naughty words. And, of course, always stick to the list.\\n\\nBest mates: to these children, love is all about being a good friend Credit: Sam Robinson\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some people, the idea of welcoming a dog or cat into their home seems like an influx of responsibility and obligation they would rather avoid. But for devoted pet owners, their furry friends are beloved members of the family with whom they share a mutually beneficial relationship.\\n\\nWhichever camp you fall into, it can’t hurt to brush up on the many benefits of owning a pet. If you’re reluctant to take the plunge, these facts may convince you. And if you’re a longtime pet parent, they’ll serve as a welcome reminder as to how your little fur ball has improved your life.\\n\\nFrom the emotional and social impact of their presence to the physical and mental benefits, having Fido the dog or Garfield the cat around the house might just be the boost you didn’t even know you needed.\\n\\nFitness\\n\\nPets need regular activity and, if a dog becomes your pet of choice, you’ll also be signing up for brisk daily walks to help your furry friend keep in shape. In turn, you’ll also feel the benefit of regular, low-impact exercise. According to a recent survey, 36 per cent of pet owners said that having a pet has helped them lose weight. Who needs a personal trainer?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nBelieve it or not, having an animal can even have an impact on your social life… in a good way. Walking the dog around the local park or taking it to obedience lessons are just two settings where you’ll have the opportunity to meet new faces and interact with people you might not otherwise have come into contact with. And don’t be surprised if you’re stopped by strangers in the street who are eager to pat your furry friend and find out more about her.\\n\\nChildhood learning and responsibility\\n\\nHaving a pet in the home is a great way for children to learn valuable life lessons in a fun, rewarding way. From the daily responsibility of feeding, exercising and caring for the animal to understanding more about illness and loss, it can equip your children (or grandchildren) with the emotions to cope better with important life events as they grow up.\\n\\nCompanionship\\n\\nThe sheer presence of a pet in the home can boost your mood, especially after a hectic day at the office or even following a difficult conversation. The stresses of life can melt away as soon as you walk through the front door and see your beloved pet, desperate for your affection. Said animal will also be your go-to companion of choice to watch a movie with or cuddle up to read a book with on a cold winter’s day. What’s better than a furry hot water bottle who listens to every word you say and doesn’t answer back?\\n\\nMental health\\n\\nNot only do pets provide companionship and help improve your physical health, they can also provide therapeutic and emotional benefits. According to Ingrid Collins, a consultant psychologist at the London Medical Centre, “A pet is better than Prozac. Animals have a completely different agenda to humans, and bring things back to basics. They want comfort, feeding and love. In return, they give huge affection.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of good news\\n\\nThe easiest way to improve your mood - and your life - is to take time each day to focus on the simple things that bring you joy.
